# Perfect Date
Have you ever scheduled a date with a special someone and then realized you didn't know what to do? Perfect Date to the rescue!
Perfect Date is a single-page application that helps you plan the perfect date by giving you some basic options: choose to go the movies or to a local event, and the app will provide you with some suggestions, as well as restaurants nearby. Choose to go to the movies, and you will be provided a list of what movies are playing locally. Choose to go to an event, and the place, time, and a description of the event will be shown to you. Can't decide? Perfect Date will display previously planned dates to provide some ideas!
